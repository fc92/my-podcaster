"The kitchen radio I can't find on the market!"

The documentation of the current implementation is available in [README-raspi.md](/README-raspi.md)

## Concept
The prototype is a little device like a "kitchen radio" that can:
- play my favorite podcasts or live web radios with one press of a button, 
- on bluetooth speakers,
- using a WiFi Internet connection.
